Problem:
  Running Tidy on this file produces the diagnostic:

    Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"

  ...when clearly the DOCTYPE is not as shown.  Problem appears to be that
  doctype is "fixed" in FixDocType before it is reported in ReportVersion.
  See "tidy.c" lines 1001, 1016.

Expected behavior:

  The DOCTYPE that appears in the file should be reported in the "Doctype
  given" diagnostic.

Verification:
  tidy -e bug-2000-12-27-a.html

Correction:
  tidy.c (main)
