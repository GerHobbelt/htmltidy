Availability:

the original libtidy (html tidy) is available through W3C/sourceforge.

This patched version is available at www.hebbut.net in the 'Public Offerings' section and
is maintained by Ger Hobbelt.

Note that this version is primarily intended to go with the .NET HtmlTidyWrapper library
to allow .NET applications easy access to the libtidy features.

Nevertheless, this code should also compile on any libtidy supported UNIX/other platforms.
